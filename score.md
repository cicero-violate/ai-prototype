# Canon Agent Score

Current date: 2026-05-10.

## Current Progress

- P0 validation baseline: complete.
- P1 validation evidence reporting: complete.
- P2 agent loop reliability: complete.
- P3 runtime and receipt correctness: complete for current scope.
- P4 graph source-of-truth integration: mostly complete for deterministic fixture/report evidence; agent-driven graph editing remains intentionally deferred until P5 domain surfaces are validated.
- P5 domain intelligence layer: active. `src/domain/contracts.rs` constructor and invariant tests through unsafe live-effect rejection are complete in local source, with prior targeted validation passing 7 contract tests.
- First incomplete Active Priorities item after fresh reconnaissance on 2026-05-10: `src/domain/identity.rs::DomainHashInput<'a>` plus the remaining deterministic identity helpers: `canonical_json_bytes(record)`, `domain_hash_json(record)`, and `domain_hash_parts(parts)`, followed by the three identity hash tests.
- Implementation step 1 status on 2026-05-10: `src/domain/identity.rs` has a local `DomainHash` newtype implementation and unit test `domain_hash_newtype_validates_prefix_and_non_empty_suffix`; prior targeted identity validation passed, but full-suite validation remains pending because repeated connector HTTP 502 errors returned before Rust output.
- Current source inventory confirms Rust files exist for `src/domain/bridge.rs`, `src/domain/contracts.rs`, `src/domain/identity.rs`, `src/domain/mod.rs`, `src/domain/risk.rs`, and `src/domain/scoring.rs`; planned Rust files `src/domain/global_intelligence.rs`, `src/domain/business.rs`, `src/domain/finance.rs`, and `src/domain/trading.rs` remain absent.
- This turn updated planning and scoring only. No implementation validation or graph refresh was performed, so no score increase is claimed.

## Graph Analysis Evidence

Python inspection of `state/rustc/ai/graph.json` on 2026-05-10:

```text
meta.schema_version   = 16
meta.crate_name       = ai
meta.graph_hash       = ab2202a8d8ec371b0c462aecc41e28d059920f53e2179dd40ebb6ebb3127fc33
meta.receipt_hash     = 0a44845e35b656d3d31b481b5e43c456d92994ca8e3179b0fd0f6213954cd4df
meta.risk_hash        = c28e55e09a0259a6697a67971c16be23a02b59581c77e6973b2e2a44588e665e
nodes                 = 4473
edges                 = 31082
intents               = 2976
node_kinds            = fn 2976, impl 1283, struct 159, enum 53, trait 1, ty_alias 1
compiled_domain_nodes = 0
broad_domain_hits     = 19
compiled_domain_name_hits = runtime::reducer::raise_domain_failure only
```

Relevant interpretation: the graph snapshot is valid evidence for the existing runtime/capability/kernel surface, but it does not yet prove the P5 domain module. Broad `domain` text hits are agent objective/prompt/cycle references and the older runtime domain-failure function, not compiled `src/domain::*` nodes. Domain progress should not be scored as graph-verified until domain tests pass and graph evidence is refreshed.

## Scores

```text
I  Intelligence      = 7.2
A  Architecture      = 8.7
E  Efficiency        = 8.4
C  Correctness       = 9.1
A  Alignment         = 8.1
R  Robustness        = 7.0
P  Performance       = 7.4
S  Scalability       = 9.3
D  Determinism       = 8.8
T  Transparency      = 8.0
Co Collaboration     = 7.9
Em Empowerment       = 8.2
B  Benefit           = 7.6
L  Learning          = 8.5
St Structure         = 7.7
Si Simplicity        = 8.4
F  Future-Proofing   = 8.1
Ch Coherency         = 8.6
```

Approximate geometric mean over the listed score axes remains about:

```text
G ~= 8.14 / 10
```

The score is not raised because this was a planning/scoring turn only. Prior targeted contract evidence is retained, but full-suite validation and refreshed graph evidence for `src/domain::*` remain pending.

## Rationale

Correctness, determinism, scalability, and coherency are strongest because the kernel, receipts, replay boundaries, graph fixture validation, validation evidence paths, and current planning direction agree on the same evidence-first architecture. Robustness, intelligence, and benefit remain lower because live graph editing, self-modification, and domain intelligence are not yet proven end to end.

Implementation step 2 evidence on 2026-05-10:

- Completed Active Priorities item 1 in `src/domain/contracts.rs`.
- Added serde coverage for domain schema primitive enums and core record structs.
- Replaced `DomainSignal.signal_class` string storage with typed `DomainSignalClass`.
- Added unit tests for schema primitive JSON round-trip and live-effect safety ordering.
- Targeted validation passed: `TMPDIR="$PWD/target/test-tmp" RUSTC_WRAPPER="" RUSTC_WORKSPACE_WRAPPER="" cargo test contracts::tests -- --test-threads=1` ran 2 domain contract tests successfully.
- Full validation command attempted twice: `TMPDIR="$PWD/target/test-tmp" RUSTC_WRAPPER="" RUSTC_WORKSPACE_WRAPPER="" cargo test --all-targets`; both attempts failed at the connector layer with HTTP 502 upstream/external service errors, so no full-suite Rust failure was observed in this turn.
- Helper-agent spawn was requested during this planning turn but failed with `connect worker on port 9100: Connection refused`; planning proceeded locally.


Planning-turn update on 2026-05-10 after fresh reconnaissance:

- Required reconnaissance completed from `/workspace/ai_sandbox/canon-mini-agent/prototype/ai`.
- First incomplete Active Priorities item is item 4: `src/domain/contracts.rs` unit test `domain_record_constructors_reject_missing_hashes`, covering required hash/provenance inputs to `DomainRiskEnvelope::new`, `DomainJudgment::new`, `DomainPlan::new`, `DomainEval::new`, and `DomainPromotionCandidate::new`.
- `find src/domain -type f | sort` confirmed Rust files `src/domain/bridge.rs`, `src/domain/contracts.rs`, `src/domain/identity.rs`, `src/domain/mod.rs`, `src/domain/risk.rs`, and `src/domain/scoring.rs`, plus design-note Markdown files for business, contracts, finance, global intelligence, integration, roadmap, scoring, and trading. Planned Rust files `src/domain/global_intelligence.rs`, `src/domain/business.rs`, `src/domain/finance.rs`, and `src/domain/trading.rs` remain absent.
- Python analysis of `state/rustc/ai/graph.json` confirmed schema version 16, graph hash `ab2202a8d8ec371b0c462aecc41e28d059920f53e2179dd40ebb6ebb3127fc33`, 4,473 nodes, 31,082 edges, 2,976 intents, 2,976 function nodes, 1,283 impl nodes, 159 struct nodes, 53 enum nodes, and no compiled `domain::` nodes. The graph files most represented are `src/validation_harness.rs`, `src/capability/llm/openai.rs`, `src/capability/llm/ollama.rs`, and `src/graph_mutation.rs`; the only node containing `domain` is `runtime::reducer::raise_domain_failure`, so graph evidence does not yet prove the P5 domain module.
- Active Priorities remain a concrete ordered checklist of file-level and test-level tasks that execute turns can pick up one at a time; the next executable task is item 4.
- `git status --short` showed pre-existing modified implementation files `src/agent/loop_driver.rs` and `src/domain/contracts.rs` before this planning patch. This turn leaves those implementation changes unstaged and commits only `plan.md` and `score.md`.

Implementation step 5 evidence on 2026-05-10:

- Completed Active Priorities item 2 in `src/domain/contracts.rs`.
- Added `DomainJudgment::new(...)`, `DomainPlan::new(...)`, `DomainEval::new(...)`, and `DomainPromotionCandidate::new(...)` constructors with explicit `DOMAIN_SCHEMA_VERSION` assignment.
- Added `DomainEval` and `DomainPromotionCandidate` record structs using the field families from `src/domain/contracts.md`.
- Extended `DomainPlan` with `required_capability_set_hash`, `expected_receipt_set_hash`, `rollback_or_invalidation_hash`, and `requested_live_effect_level` to make plan provenance, receipt expectations, rollback/invalidation material, and live-effect constraints explicit.
- Exported `DomainEval` and `DomainPromotionCandidate` from `src/domain/mod.rs`.
- Validation attempts were blocked by connector transport failures: two targeted `cargo test contracts::tests -- --test-threads=1` attempts and one `canon_execute_evaluator_suite` `rust_full_validation` attempt returned HTTP 502 upstream/external service errors before Rust output was available in this turn.
- Scores remain unchanged at `G ~= 8.14 / 10` because implementation advanced, but this turn did not obtain fresh successful full-suite validation evidence.

Implementation step 7 evidence on 2026-05-10:

- Completed Active Priorities item 3 in `src/domain/contracts.rs`.
- Added unit test `domain_record_constructors_validate_invariants` covering success paths for `DomainRiskEnvelope::new`, `DomainJudgment::new`, `DomainPlan::new`, `DomainEval::new`, and `DomainPromotionCandidate::new`.
- The test asserts explicit `DOMAIN_SCHEMA_VERSION` assignment, bounded score retention, hash/provenance retention, bridge target retention, promotion flag retention, and safe live-effect retention.
- Targeted validation passed after one connector retry: `TMPDIR="$PWD/target/test-tmp" RUSTC_WRAPPER="" RUSTC_WORKSPACE_WRAPPER="" cargo test contracts::tests -- --test-threads=1` ran 4 domain contract tests successfully.
- Full validation command attempted twice: `TMPDIR="$PWD/target/test-tmp" RUSTC_WRAPPER="" RUSTC_WORKSPACE_WRAPPER="" cargo test --all-targets`; both attempts returned connector HTTP 502 upstream/external service errors before full-suite Rust output was available.
- Scores remain unchanged at `G ~= 8.14 / 10`; targeted evidence improved contract confidence, but full-suite validation and graph refresh are still unavailable.


Implementation step 1 evidence on 2026-05-10:

- Completed Active Priorities item 4 in `src/domain/contracts.rs`.
- Added unit test `domain_record_constructors_reject_missing_hashes` covering missing or blank required hash/provenance inputs for `DomainRiskEnvelope::new`, `DomainJudgment::new`, `DomainPlan::new`, `DomainEval::new`, and `DomainPromotionCandidate::new`.
- The test checks whitespace-only values as missing via constructor paths and asserts the precise `DomainContractError::EmptyField(...)` field names for envelope id, judgment rationale hash, all plan hash fields, eval hashes, and promotion candidate hashes.
- Targeted validation passed after one connector retry: `TMPDIR="$PWD/target/test-tmp" RUSTC_WRAPPER="" RUSTC_WORKSPACE_WRAPPER="" cargo test contracts::tests -- --test-threads=1` ran 5 domain contract tests successfully.
- Full validation command attempted twice: `TMPDIR="$PWD/target/test-tmp" RUSTC_WRAPPER="" RUSTC_WORKSPACE_WRAPPER="" cargo test --all-targets`; both attempts returned connector HTTP 502 upstream/external service errors before full-suite Rust output was available.
- Predefined `rust_full_validation` evaluator suite also returned connector HTTP 502 before evaluator output was available.
- Scores remain at `G ~= 8.14 / 10`; targeted contract evidence improved local confidence, but full-suite validation and graph refresh are still unavailable.
- Next executable task is Active Priorities item 5: `src/domain/contracts.rs::domain_record_constructors_reject_out_of_range_scores`.

Planning-turn reconciliation on 2026-05-10:

- Required reconnaissance completed from the project root using `cwd=.` because the shell wrapper rejects the absolute path while resolving `.` to `/workspace/ai_sandbox/canon-mini-agent/prototype/ai`.
- First incomplete item found in `plan.md` before reconciliation was item 5: `src/domain/contracts.rs::domain_record_constructors_reject_out_of_range_scores`, covering out-of-range score/risk constructor inputs for `DomainRiskEnvelope::new`, `DomainJudgment::new`, `DomainPlan::new`, `DomainEval::new`, and `DomainPromotionCandidate::new`.
- Source inspection showed `domain_record_constructors_reject_out_of_range_scores` already present in `src/domain/contracts.rs`, covering risk envelope, judgment, eval, and promotion candidate score fields, with `DomainPlan::new(...)` correctly treated as having no score fields. The active checklist was updated to mark item 5 complete in local source and make item 6 the next executable task.
- Next executable task is Active Priorities item 6: `src/domain/contracts.rs::domain_plan_constructor_rejects_unsafe_live_effects`, covering unsafe live-effect rejection in `DomainPlan::new(...)` for finance research/analysis and trading simulation plan kinds.
- `find src/domain -type f | sort` confirmed Rust files `src/domain/bridge.rs`, `src/domain/contracts.rs`, `src/domain/identity.rs`, `src/domain/mod.rs`, `src/domain/risk.rs`, and `src/domain/scoring.rs`; planned Rust files `src/domain/global_intelligence.rs`, `src/domain/business.rs`, `src/domain/finance.rs`, and `src/domain/trading.rs` remain absent.
- Python graph analysis of `state/rustc/ai/graph.json` reconfirmed schema version 16, graph hash `ab2202a8d8ec371b0c462aecc41e28d059920f53e2179dd40ebb6ebb3127fc33`, 4,473 nodes, 31,082 edges, 2,976 intents, 2,976 function nodes, 1,283 impl nodes, 159 struct nodes, 53 enum nodes, and no compiled `domain::` nodes.
- Scores remain at `G ~= 8.14 / 10`; this was a planning/scoring turn, with no implementation validation or graph refresh performed.
- Commit scope for this turn is limited to `plan.md` and `score.md`; pre-existing modified implementation/runtime files remain unstaged.

Implementation step 1 evidence on 2026-05-10:

- Completed Active Priorities item 5 in `src/domain/contracts.rs` by adding `domain_record_constructors_reject_out_of_range_scores`.
- Completed Active Priorities item 6 in `src/domain/contracts.rs` by adding `domain_plan_constructor_rejects_unsafe_live_effects`.
- Item 5 asserts `DomainContractError::ScoreOutOfRange { value: 1001, .. }` for every score-bearing constructor field in `DomainRiskEnvelope::new`, `DomainJudgment::new`, `DomainEval::new`, and `DomainPromotionCandidate::new`; `DomainPlan::new` has no score fields, so it is asserted on a valid no-score constructor path.
- Item 6 asserts unsafe live-effect rejection for `DomainPlanKind::FinanceResearch`, `DomainPlanKind::FinanceAnalysisPlan`, `DomainPlanKind::TradingSimulation`, and `DomainPlanKind::TradingSimulationPlan` when external write or financial execution is requested, plus allowed-boundary cases for finance read-only and trading sandbox write.
- Targeted validation passed after one connector retry: `TMPDIR="$PWD/target/test-tmp" RUSTC_WRAPPER="" RUSTC_WORKSPACE_WRAPPER="" cargo test contracts::tests -- --test-threads=1` ran 7 domain contract tests successfully.
- Full validation command attempted twice after the targeted pass: `TMPDIR="$PWD/target/test-tmp" RUSTC_WRAPPER="" RUSTC_WORKSPACE_WRAPPER="" cargo test --all-targets`; both attempts returned connector HTTP 502 upstream/external service errors before full-suite Rust output was available.
- Scores remain at `G ~= 8.14 / 10`; targeted contract evidence improved local confidence, but full-suite validation and graph refresh are still unavailable.
- Next executable task is Active Priorities item 2: `src/domain/identity.rs::DomainHashInput<'a>`, followed by canonical JSON bytes and hash helper implementation.


Planning-turn update on 2026-05-10 after required reconnaissance:

- Read `plan.md` and identified the first incomplete Active Priorities item as `src/domain/identity.rs` deterministic identity hashing. Local source already contains the `DomainHash` newtype and `domain_hash_newtype_validates_prefix_and_non_empty_suffix`; the next executable task is `src/domain/identity.rs::DomainHashInput<'a>`.
- Ran `find src/domain -type f | sort`; Rust files present are `src/domain/bridge.rs`, `src/domain/contracts.rs`, `src/domain/identity.rs`, `src/domain/mod.rs`, `src/domain/risk.rs`, and `src/domain/scoring.rs`. Planned Rust files `src/domain/global_intelligence.rs`, `src/domain/business.rs`, `src/domain/finance.rs`, and `src/domain/trading.rs` remain absent.
- Python analysis of `state/rustc/ai/graph.json` found top-level keys `edges`, `intents`, `meta`, and `nodes`; schema version remains 16, graph hash remains `ab2202a8d8ec371b0c462aecc41e28d059920f53e2179dd40ebb6ebb3127fc33`, with 4,473 node entries, 31,082 edges, and 2,976 intents. The graph still has no compiled `domain::` node evidence.
- Updated `plan.md` so Active Priorities are a concrete ordered file/test checklist and clarified that item 2, `src/domain/identity.rs::DomainHashInput<'a>`, is the next single execute-turn task.
- Updated scoring commentary only. Scores remain at `G ~= 8.14 / 10` because this planning turn performed no implementation validation, full-suite validation, or graph refresh.
- Commit scope for this turn is limited to `plan.md` and `score.md`; existing implementation changes in `src/agent/loop_driver.rs` and `src/domain/identity.rs` remain unstaged.

Planning-turn update on 2026-05-10 after current reconnaissance:

- Required reconnaissance completed from `/workspace/ai_sandbox/canon-mini-agent/prototype/ai` using the shell wrapper with `cwd=.` because the wrapper resolves `.` to the required working directory.
- Read `plan.md` and identified the first incomplete Active Priorities item as `src/domain/identity.rs::DomainHashInput<'a>`; the local source already contains `DomainHash`, `DomainHashError`, `stable_domain_id(parts)`, `stable_identity_is_order_sensitive_and_repeatable`, and `domain_hash_newtype_validates_prefix_and_non_empty_suffix`.
- Ran `find src/domain -type f | sort`; Rust files present remain `src/domain/bridge.rs`, `src/domain/contracts.rs`, `src/domain/identity.rs`, `src/domain/mod.rs`, `src/domain/risk.rs`, and `src/domain/scoring.rs`.

No compiled `domain::` graph node evidence is present.
- Updated `plan.md` to name `src/domain/identity.rs::DomainHashInput<'a>` as the first incomplete executable task and to keep Active Priorities as a file/test-level ordered checklist.
- Updated scoring commentary only. Scores remain at `G ~= 8.14 / 10` because this planning turn performed no implementation validation, full-suite validation, or graph refresh.

The next score gains should come from evidence, not optimism:

- prove agent-driven graph mutation with Python-assisted graph target selection;
- stabilize domain record contracts and fixtures;
- route self-modification through verified evolution with external eval evidence;
- keep trading sandbox-only until explicit future policy exists.
